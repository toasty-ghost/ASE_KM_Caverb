FFTW Notes from Will Pirkle:

This folder holds the fftw3.h file which is needed for both Visual Studio and Xcode. The file is included in its entirety along with the FFTW copyright information.

Windows Only:
This folder contains two sub-folders, one for x86 and the other for x64. You need to populate these folders with the DLL and LIB files libfftw3-3.dll and libfftw3-3.lib files that you either build yourself or that you download (see ASPiK Documentation).

In addition, the Windows version requires that you place the libfftw3-3.dll file in the same folder as your DAW's executable. For licensing FFTW to package everything together, see the SDK or fftw.org
